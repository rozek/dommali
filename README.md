# dommali #

a lightweight DOM manipulation library with jQuery-inspired "fluent" API

The use of jQuery makes DOM manipulation code compact and legible - but it is a rather large library with many no longer required features. The idea behind `dommali` is to create a thin layer on top of the API of modern browsers (excluding MS IE and "classic" MS Edge!) that still allows code to be as concise as jQuery would do.

`dommali` was inspired by [nanoJS](https://github.com/vladocar/nanoJS) and [femtoJS](https://github.com/vladocar/femtoJS) - and like those, its implementation is so simple that it is not too difficult to add new methods or remove unwanted ones in order to enhance functionality or reduce size.

> Important: `dommali` is no drop-in replacement for jQuery! If you need something like that, look for [Zepto.js](https://github.com/ZeptoJS/Zepto.js), [Cash](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/cash), [UmbrellaJS](https://github.com/franciscop/umbrella), [Chibi](https://github.com/kylebarrow/chibi) or similar
