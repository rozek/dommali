# dommali #

a lightweight DOM manipulation library with jQuery-inspired "fluent" API

The use of jQuery makes DOM manipulation code much more compact and legible - but it is a rather large library with many no longer required features. The idea behind `dommali` is to create a thin layer on top of the API of modern browsers (excluding any IE support!) that still allows code to be as concise as jQuery would do.

`dommali` was inspired by [nanoJS](https://github.com/vladocar/nanoJS) and [femtoJS](https://github.com/vladocar/femtoJS)
